# Sound_of_Drugs - Translating Drugs into Sound

There already is a well-established market for so called audio drugs. Companies like i-Doser offer binaural-beats sound pieces which try to give the listener a High which imitates the trip you would get from taking a certain drug like THC or MDMA.
However, this artistic research project approaches the field of turning drugs into sound from a different angle. Instead of trying to imitate certain Highs through sound, I developed a Concept to turn Drugs into sound through the analogue translation of drug categories.
I have selected the following drugs a for my work:
DMT, LSD, Cocaine, MDMA, Caffeine, Nicotine, Ethanol, Methamphetamin

For the translation of the drugs into Sound Parameters, I used the following categories to create a dataset of the drugs:
Duration until Effect, Psychological Reactions, Chemical Formular, Duration of Effect, Physiological Reactions

The Sound parameters are as following:
Pitch, Amplitude, Rhythm, Sound, Duration, Melodics

For producing the Sound, I have worked with the program Sonic-Pi. Sonic Pi is a live coding environment based on the programming language Ruby.

Please note that this is a first prototype of a huger project. The dataset is not complete and the code will be improved in the near future.
